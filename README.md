## Usage

To provide a brief usage guide for your project, follow these steps:

Install Git on your computer if it's not already installed. Visit the official Git website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
Configure your basic information (name and email) on your local machine using the terminal. Run the following commands, replacing "Your Name" with your actual name and "youremail@example.com" with your email address.
Create a new repository on GitHub.com using the graphic interface. Provide a repository name, such as "zero_day", and set it as a public repository. Avoid adding a README, .gitignore, or license during this step.
On your computer, open a terminal and navigate to your home directory.
Create a directory named "zero_day"
Navigate to the newly created "zero_day" directory.
Initialize Git in the directory and add the remote origin.Replace <repository_url> with the URL of your GitHub repository.
Create a file named "README.md" in the "zero_day" directory. Use your preferred command-line editor to write a brief Markdown text introducing and presenting your project.

Remember to save your changes to the "README.md" file and continue with other Git operations as needed.
